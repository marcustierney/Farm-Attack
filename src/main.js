Farm Attack

I am proud of having implemented a various amount of different enmeies which all have different behaviors. The enemies also gradually speed up over time, making the game progressly more difficult. I am also proud of implementing a pause button using a list which stores the velocity of each enemy on the screen when the pause button is pressed (scene.pause() and scene.resume() wouldn't work because it would change the velocity of the enemies).
This is not the traditional endless runner in that the player has more control over their movement as they're allowed to move in all directions freely.
